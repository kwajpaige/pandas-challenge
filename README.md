pandas-challenge: PyCitySchools
Analyze the district-wide standardized test results.  Given every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend, aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance. 
 
 Project includes:
1) Use the pandas library and Jupyter Notebook.
2) submit a link to your Github/Git Lab repo that contains your Jupyter Notebook.
3) Include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

Objective:
Help the  school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.


Project Specifics:
Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:

Total Schools
Total Students
Total Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


School Summary

1) Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school.
2) Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing.
3) Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing.
4) Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
5) Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
6) Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending.
